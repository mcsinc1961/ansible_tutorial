EE - AUTOMATION EXECUTION ENVIROMENTS = Cdollections, Lirraries, Ansible Core

BUILD, CREATE, PUBLISH  
 1. Content Creater, 
 2. EE builder : Ansibile Buillder = collections, dependencies, ansible core
 3. Private automation hub = local on-premisises  hosting EE enviroments or 	collections

DEVELOP, TEST, RUN containerized Ansible content 
	content creater allows you to zoom in and out of plays.
	Automatiion content navigator = Scalable Supported playbook and EE  
	that can run execution levels.
  
HOW ANSIBLE AUTOMATION WORKS
 1. LOCAL Execution = Network devices, API Endpoints
 2. REMMOTE Execution = Linux / Windows Hosts
